    <h2>Criteria</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The image processing algorithm must reliably differentiate between forks, knives, and spoons.
      </li>
      <li>
        Based on feedback from the image processing algorithms, the Zumy should navigate to the appropriate location.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Zumy should be able to move the utensil without losing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Zumy should avoid all obstacles on the field, and leave any existing utensil piles undisturbed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          On a request, the dispenser must dispense one random utensil in a configuration suitable for Zumy pickup.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once the dispenser is empty (i.e. the task is finished), the Zumy should disengage.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design choices</h2>
    b) Describe the design you chose.
    c) What design choices did you make when you formulated your design? What tradeoffs did you have to make?
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Feasability</h2>
    d) How do these design choices impact how well the project meets design criteria which would be encountered in a real
engineering application, such as robustness, durability, and efficiency?
